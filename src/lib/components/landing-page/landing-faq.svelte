            Bonded.app tracks and reports behaviors that affect dating and relationship
            transparency. These include relationship status verification, activity on dating sites,
            patterns of ghosting or flaking, appearance accuracy compared to profile pictures, and
            any potential instances of infidelity. Each report is peer-reviewed to ensure accuracy
            and fairness, so users can trust the information provided.

            Can I report someone anonymously?

          <dd class="mt-2 text-base/7 text-stone-600">
            Yes, bonded.app allows users to report others anonymously to protect privacy and
            encourage honest reporting. When a report is submitted, the reported person and their
            linked partner can review the information without knowing who submitted it. Anonymous
            reporting helps maintain a safe environment for all users, especially those sharing
            sensitive information, while ensuring accountability through our peer-review process.

          <dd class="mt-2 text-base/7 text-stone-600">
            If a false report is submitted against you, it goes through our peer-review system,
            where other users help verify its accuracy. If a report is flagged as false, it won’t be
            displayed on your profile, and the individual who submitted the false claim may receive
            a “false report” marker on their profile. This discourages misuse of the reporting
            system and protects users from defamation or baseless claims.

            We recognize and respect that every relationship is unique, whether it’s monogamous,
            polyamorous, open, or something else entirely. Our platform is committed to inclusivity
            and to supporting all walks of life by providing a safe, transparent environment for

            Your privacy is our priority. General searches only show basic info, X-Ray users see
            limited behavior patterns, and only verified, linked partners can view a full history or
            receive partner-related notifications. Sensitive details stay protected and are shared
            only with trusted connections.

            enforcement to address issues swiftly and responsibly. Our goal is to protect users and
